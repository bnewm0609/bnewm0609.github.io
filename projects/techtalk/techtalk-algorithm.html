	<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h1>
		<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>
		An algorithm is a series of steps that are followed to achieve some goal.</p>
		<p><strong>How is the phrase used?</strong><br>
		The word “algorithm” is used by tech companies as an alternative to “method” or “process”. It is used by computer science researchers to analyze and compare their problem-solving tools and to rigourously define and prove their solutions.</p>
		<p><strong>Deeper Explanation</strong><br>
		Algorithms are sequences of instructions that are followed to achieve some result. Google Maps and Waze uses algorithms to find the shortest and least busy routes between locations; Uber and Lyft use algorithms to determine how much to charge you; and Google and Youtube use algorithms to decide the order to show their content. Algorithms exist outside of computer science: Rubik’s Cube aficionados memorize sequences of ways to turn the cube to solve it from a certain state. A lot of the math you learn in elementry school and middle school, such as adding whole numbers, long division, or even finding the greatest common factor are all algorithms: you memorize a series of rules (“add the digits and carry the one…”) to apply to a problem repeatedly until it is solved. Algorithms even show up in your kitchen in the form of recipes! (In the form of steps for cooking a thing.)</p>
		<p>An important note is that algorithms are the instructions, so they don’t <em>know</em> anything about you just in the same way that a recipe for pumpkin pie doesn’t actually <em>know</em> if you have 2 cans of pumpkin in your house. When people hear about “algorithms controlling their lives,” the problem is not really from algorithms having your personal information. Problems can arise in algorithms when the instructions themselves, i.e. how they use the data they get, can lead to unintended or ill-advised consequences. For example, Facebook has an algorithm to determine what posts are shown in your newsfeed and maybe whether you’ve liked previous posts by a user is a major factor, but this might lead to you not seeing other people’s posts as often. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> by Cathy O’Neil is a great read about the kinds of [uninteneded] consequences that pop up in algorithm design.</p>
		<p>One of the handy things about algorithms is that they can very often be used in a variety of contexts. For this reason Hackernoon writer <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@kozyrkov?source=post_header_lockup">Cassie Kozyrkov</a> refers to algorithms as “appliances”–they are flexible tools that you use for certain types of tasks. A microwave oven, for example, doesn’t care what you put inside it, because it will always shower its contents with microwave radiation regardless. In the same way, Netflix might use a “machine learning” algorithm to recommend movies that you might like the same way gmail would use one to detect spam. A set of commonly use algorithms make up what programmers sometimes refer to as their “algorithmic toolboxes.” Researchers develop new algorithms for different types of tasks and engineers add them to their boxes.</p>
		<p><strong>Linguistics Perspective</strong><br>
		The word <em>algorithm</em> comes from the name of the Persian mathematician who introduced Europeans to algebra and the digits 0-9 that we all know and love today. His name was Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, and his last name was translated into Latin as <em>Algoritmi</em>.</p>
