Tech companies use the term to try and attract attention and funding to their products. News sources use it when discussing new technology to evoke a sense of awe and fear of progress, and occasionally a sense of human responsibility. Researchers in computer science, statistics, social sciences, and philosophy departments (along with others), use the term to discuss their academic work and its impact. Like any buzzword, the term itself does not really say anything about the quality of the work; it usually only vaguely refers to computers doing some tasks traditionally performed by humans.</p>	<p><strong>Deeper Explanation</strong></p>	<p>The AI wikipedia article defines artificial intelligence as a subfield of computer science that focuses on the study of programming computers to perceive their environment and take steps to achieve some pre-defined goal. The definition is quite vague and has two main components: computers perceiving things and computers carrying out tasks. The perception can come in many forms from camera pictures to temperature sensor readings. The tasks can also vary widely from identifying birds in a photo to predicting tomorrow's weather.</p>	<p>Usually, AI is discussed with some comparison (implicit or explicit) to <i>natural </i>or <i>human intelligence</i> - what humans can perceive and do. When people talk about Google's Duplex product that uses artificial intelligence to communicate over the phone to restaurant owners to make reservations, or when they discuss the ethics of China's face-tracking and identification surveillance, they are comparing what computers can do to what humans can do. (Try and identify the perception and task in each of these examples). Quora user Adarash has a great example of this distinction: natural (or human) intelligence is you opening your phone and turning on airplane mode when you step into the airport.  Artificial intelligence is your phone comparing its current location, according to its GPS, with a list of airport locations across the world and turning on airplane mode when the two overlap. This is a great example showing that artificial intelligence doesn't have to be particularly <i>smart</i>. There's nothing really clever or ingenious about comparing your gps coordinates to airports'; computers can just do it fast enough that it seems instantaneous. It's also a good example because it shows where modern information privacy concerns originate: while the phone perceives you are in an airport from your location, that's pretty much the limit of its information. The gps coordinates might not be precise enough to know which gate you're at or where you're buying your coffee. How much information a computer (or human) has about you is limited both by the capabilities of its sensors and your willingness to use their potentially convenient features.</p>	<p>This auto-airport functionality, along with Chinese face-tracking, Google's speech comprehension, and Netflix recommendations are all examples the "narrow" or "weak" AI subcategory of AI. Narrow AI concerns itself with these types of very specific tasks; all modern AI implementations are examples of narrow AI. That being said, in some philosophical circles and certain future-facing articles there is a lot of discussion about the prospect of artificial intelligence gaining all aspects of human intelligence. This separate sub-field of AI is referred to as "strong" or "general" AI, usually abbreviated "AGI" for Artificial General Intelligence. This type of AI does not exist. Occasionally you might see these two types of AI conflated, as in the sentiment "AI can do <i>X</i> task, so it can't be long before AI can do everything." These ideas miss out on the fact that the human brain is not really an amalgamation of individual task completers, and progress in the narrow AI sub-category does not necessarily mean progress for AGI.</p>	<p><strong>Linguistics Perspective</strong></p>	<p>The word artificial carries with it connotations of falseness, which is interesting because it isn't really the intelligence that is fake-AI researchers work hard figuring out how to get computers to perform tasks that are usually considered to require some type of cognition (such as speech recognition, visual analysis and object recognition, language creation, etc.) at the level, and sometimes better than, humans are capable of. Instead the "artificial" refers to the fact that this intelligence is found in computers rather than some biological being, using the meaning of "constructed" and the antonym of "natural". </p>	<p><strong>Resources to learn more:</strong></p>	<p><ul>		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence</a> </li>		<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-explain-artificial-intelligence-in-laymans-terms">https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-explain-artificial-intelligence-in-laymans-terms</a></li>		<li><a href="https://stopad.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-facts">https://stopad.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-facts</a> (Author writes tech articles on blog for Adblocker)</li>		<li><a href="https://medium.com/@Francesco_AI/artificial-intelligence-what-it-is-and-why-now-4e4431942623">https://medium.com/@Francesco_AI/artificial-intelligence-what-it-is-and-why-now-4e4431942623</a> (Article is kinda meh but the sources are interesting)</li>	</ul></p>		<p><b>Related Articles:</b></p>		<p><ul>			<li>Henry Kissinger's poor analysis of Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/</a></li>			<li>A good follow up piece to Kissinger's discussing its issues can be found here: <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/kissinger-ai">https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/kissinger-ai</a> </li>			<li>NY Times article about China's facial-recognition surveillence: <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html</a> </li>		</ul></p>		</body>		</html>
